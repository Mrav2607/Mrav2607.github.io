          This year, I've been focusing on developing my skills in full-stack development and exploring new technologies to stay updated in the ever-evolving field of web development. For example, I've recently completed a project using <em>React</em> and <em>Node.js</em> to build a dynamic web application. You can check out my portfolio to see some of my latest work.
